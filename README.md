# Home Assistant Divera Alarm

I currently noticed that there isn't any documented way on how to get the [Divera](https://www.divera247.com/) alarms into Home Assistant. Sadly I'm not able to create my own integration for it, but I show you my workaround to get the alarms into Home Assistant


## 1. Get your user accesskey from Divera
1. Login to the [Divera](https://www.divera247.com/) website
2. Open the settings
3. Inside the "debug" tab you can find your user-accesskey

## 2. Create two rest sensors
See [sensor.yaml](sensor.yaml)

Replace the `<ACCESSSKEY>` three times (line 9, 34, 36) with your user-accesskey, which you noted in the first step. 

**Explanation:**

The first sensor just check if a new alarm-id is available. This sensor is updated every 60 seconds. If you need to check more often, you can set the value down to 30 seconds.
The state of this sensor is mostly empty and only shows the alarm-id when there is an active alarm.

The second sensor get the details from the new alarm. Because we need to know the current alarm-id, to get the details for the  alarm, we use the `sensor.divera_id` (from the first sensor) inside the second rest call.
This sensor is updated automatically only once a week , because we trigger the update via the automation. 

## 3. Create an automation

### Preffered/easy way: Use my prebuild blueprint


Click this link or add the blueprint manually:

<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FN1c093%2FHA_divera-alarm%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprint_divera_alarm.yaml" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled." /></a>



Go to **Configuration** and then **Blueprints**. Click on the blue â€œImport Blueprint" button in the bottom right.
Add the following URL: https://github.com/N1c093/HA_divera-alarm/blob/main/blueprint_divera_alarm.yaml

### Alternative way: Use my automation

See [automation.yaml](automation.yaml)


## Have fun with your Divera alarms inside Home Assistant
If there is anything unclear with my explanation or you find a problem, just open a new discussion or an issue.
